            <p>Welcome to the ultimate fanpage for Baldur's Gate! A place to dive in and explore the main lore, hidden lore, 
                characters, and my own personal opinions about each one of the characters and story. 
                As a big fan of Larian Studios and this game, this page is basically a love letter to this <strong>masterpiece</strong>. 
                There is no other other way to describe this game than by calling it a masterpiece. There's the already established
                Dungeons & Dragons Lore to furth enrich the story of the game, mechanics and gameplay that are second to none,
                and amazingly well written characters, dialogues and secrets. Truly, this game is a work of art.
                <br/><br/>Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing video game that is in the universe of Dungeons & Dragons, an already well 
                established and evergrowing fantasy universe. And this is not only a game that has races and mechanics from the D&D universe,
                but it is also a game that has characters from the own D&D universe, such as Minsc and Boo, who are fan-favorites.
                There are also locations that appear in D&D lore, such as Baldur's Gate, the Underdark, Avernus, the Whispering Depths, and 
                many more. The game is set in the Forgotten Realms, one of the most popular settings in Dungeons & Dragons.
